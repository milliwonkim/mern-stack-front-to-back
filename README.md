- past token would be expired. So get the new token like this.

- once we get into our react application here, obviously we are not gonna have to manually add the token and stuff</br>
we are gonna get it, it's gonna get stored in local storage and it will just sit there, it will be used as long as we are logged in

- we don't want this form-data, we want the stuff like picture 4
![](images/post-create-route-4.png)
- it gets results
- we didn't add the avatar or name or anything like that. that's gonna come through our react application

- but if we wanted to add another one, we can add it
